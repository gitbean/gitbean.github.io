[Sighs] Phil, would you get them?<br>[Video Game Sounds]<br>​        Yeah. Just a sec.<br>Kids!<br>That is- Okay.<br>​        Kids? Get down here!<br>Why are you guys yelling at us when we’re way upstairs?<br>Just text me.<br>​        All right.<br>​        That’s not gonna happen.<br>​        And, wow! You’re not wearing that outfit.<br>What’s wrong with it?<br>​        Honey, do you have anything to say to your daughter… about her skirt?<br>Sorry.<br>​        Oh, yeah. That looks really cute, sweetheart.<br>Thanks.<br>​        No. It’s way too short. People know you’re a girl. You don’t need to prove it to them.<br>Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.<br>I got it.<br>Where’s the baby oil?<br>It’s on our bedside tab-<br>I don’t know. Find it.<br>Come on!<br>I was out of control growing up.<br>There, you know? I said it.<br>I-I just don’t want my kids… to make the same bad mistakes I made.<br>I-If Haley never wakes up on a beach in Florida, half-naked, I’ve done my job.<br>Our job.<br>Right.<br>I’ve done our job.<br>Vamos, Manny!<br>Kick it! Kick it!<br>Don’t let him-<br>Kick it!<br>Manny, go!<br>A la derecha! A la derecha!<br>No!

The murders.<br>Manny, stop him!<br>Stop him!<br>You can do it!<br>Boy: Damn it, Manny!<br>Come on, Coach.<br>You gotta take that kid out.<br>You wanna take him out?<br>How about I take you out?<br>Honey, honey.<br>Why don’t you worry about your son?<br>He spent the first half with his hand in his pants!<br>[Mouths Word]<br>I’ve wanted to tell her off for the last six weeks.<br>I’m Josh. Ryan’s dad.<br>Hi, I’m Gloria Pritchett. Manny’s mother.<br>Oh, and this must be your dad.<br>Her dad?<br>Yeah.<br>No, no. That’s funny.<br>Actually, no, I’m her husband.<br>Don’t be fooled by the, uh-<br>Give me a second here.<br>Who is a good girl?<br>Who’s that?<br>Who’s that?<br>Oh, she’s adorable.<br>Oh, thank you.<br>Hi, precious.<br>Hello.<br>[Blows Raspberry]<br>Hi. Hi.<br>Uh, we just, uh- We just adopted her from Vietnam.<br>And we’re bringing her home for the first time, huh?<br>She’s an angel. You and your wife must be thrilled.<br>Sorry, sorry, sorry. Daddy needed snacks.<br>Hi.<br>[Grunts] So, what are we talking about?<br>Uh, we have been together for- guh, five- five years now?<br>And, uh, we just- we decided we really wanted to have a baby.<br>So, we had initially asked one of our lesbian friends to be a surrogate, but-<br>Then we figured, they’re already mean enough.<br>Can you imagine one of ‘em pregnant?<br>Pregnant, no.<br>No, thank you. Ick.<br>You saw that, right?<br>Everybody fawning over Lily, and then you walk on and suddenly it’s all, “Ooh, SkyMall.<br>I gotta buy a motorized tie rack.”<br>All right, you know, I’m gonna give the speech.<br>You are not giving the speech.<br>You’re gonna be stuck with these people for the next five hours.<br>You’re right, you’re right. Okay. I’m sorry.<br>Look at that baby with those cream puffs.<br>Okay. Excuse me.<br>Excuse me.<br>This baby would have grown up in a crowded orphanage if it wasn’t for us “cream puffs.”<br>And you know what? Note to all of you who judge- Mitchell!<br>Hear this. Love knows no race, creed-<br>Mitchell.<br>Or gender.<br>And shame on you, you small-minded, ignorant few-<br>Mitchell.<br>Mitchell!<br>What?<br>[Whispers] She’s got the cream puffs.<br>Oh.<br>We would like to pay for everyone’s headsets.<br>Man:<br>♪ Hey, hey ♪<br>♪ Hey, hey Hey, hey ♪<br>♪ Hey, hey Hey ♪♪<br>Buddy.

[Chuckles]<br>I’m having a friend over today.<br>Who?<br>Uh, you don’t know him.<br>Him? Him?<br>Ooh, a boy.<br>You gonna kiss him?<br>Shut up.<br>Phil: Easy. Easy.<br>Yeah, shut up!<br>No, you shut up!<br>Luke, Alex, why don’t you take it outside, okay?<br>And do what?<br>Fight in the sun.<br>It’ll be a nice change.<br>Haley.<br>Phil: I’m kidding.<br>Who’s the boy?<br>His name is Dylan.<br>I might as well tell him not to come… because you guys are just going to embarrass me again.<br>Sweetie, hang on a second.<br>You’re 15, and it’s the first time you’ve had a boy over.<br>I’m bound to be a little surprised, but I’m not gonna embarrass you.<br>I better charge the camcorder.<br>[Cries Out]<br>I’m kidding. Come on.<br>Who are you talking to?<br>I’m the cool dad.<br>That’s- That’s my thing.<br>I’m hip.<br>I- I surf the Web.<br>I text. “LOL”- Laugh out loud. “OMG”- Oh, my God.<br>“WTF”- Why the face?<br>Um, you know, I know all the dances to High School Musical, so-<br>[With Recording]<br>♪ We’re all in this together ♪<br>♪ Yes, we are ♪<br>♪ We’re all stars Something, something you know it ♪♪<br>Alex: Mom! Dad!<br>Claire: What happened?<br>Luke just shot me!<br>I didn’t mean to.<br>Are you okay?<br>No.<br>The little bitch shot me.<br>[Chuckles]<br>Language!<br>They’re only plastic BBs.<br>It was an accident.<br>What did I tell you would happen if you got him a gun?<br>Deal with this.<br>Buddy, uncool.<br>That’s it? That’s-<br>No, no, no, no.<br>The agreement was that if he shoots someone, you shoot him.<br>We were serious about that?<br>Yes, we were.<br>And now you have to follow through.<br>[Crying] I’m so sorry.<br>Liar.<br>Go.<br>He’s got a birthday party.<br>What’s more important here, Dad?<br>You can shoot him afterwards.<br>He’ll be home at 2:00.<br>I can’t shoot him at 2:00.<br>I’m showing a house at 2:00.<br>What about 3:00?<br>No, he’s got a soccer game at 3:00.<br>And then-<br>Oh, we gotta leave for that dinner thing at 5:00.<br>4:15. You could shoot him at 4:15.<br>Yeah, I guess that works for me.<br>Oh!<br>“Shoot Luke.”<br>Sorry, dude.<br>It’s on the calendar.<br>Oh, come on!<br>I’m quitting soccer.<br>It is a game for children.<br>No, you’re not quitting.<br>You would have stopped that goal if you weren’t staring at that little girl.<br>She is not a girl.<br>She’s a woman.<br>You know, Gloria, that little blowup with that other mom-<br>Why do you have to do things like that?<br>If somebody says something about my family, I’m going to-<br>I’m just saying.<br>You could take it down here a little bit.<br>That’s all.<br>Oh, yeah.<br>‘Cause that’s where you live, down here.<br>But I live up here!<br>Yeah, but you don’t have to be so emotional all the time.<br>That’s all I’m saying.<br>Manny, you’re with me on this, right?<br>I wanna tell Brenda Feldman I love her.<br>Oh, for God sakes.<br>Manny, she’s 16.<br>Oh. It’s okay for you to take an older lover?<br>Hey, watch it.<br>I wanna go to the mall where she works.<br>But first I need to get my white shirt, the silk one.<br>Okay. If that’s what you really want to do.<br>Seriously.<br>Not to be the evil stepdad, but if you put on a puffy white shirt… and declare your love for a 16-year-old, you’re gonna be swinging from the flagpole in your puffy white underpants.<br>Stop the car.<br>Oh, where are you going?<br>[Car Horn Honking]<br>See? You hurt his feelings.<br>Ah- Well, if it toughens him up a little bit then-<br>Oh, geez.<br>He’s picking flowers.<br>Manny’s very passionate, just like his father.<br>My first husband- he’s very handsome, but too crazy.<br>It seemed like all we did was fight and make love, fight and make love, fight and make love.<br>One time, I’m not kidding you, we fell out the window together.<br>[Laughing] Which- Which one were you doing?<br>[Chuckles]<br>I’m hearing this for the first time.<br>This doesn’t worry you?<br>She barely slept on the plane and she’s still wide awake.<br>Oh, stop worrying.<br>I can’t.<br>That- That orphanage was all women.<br>Maybe she just- she can’t fall asleep unless she feels a woman’s shape.<br>I guess that’s possible.<br>So here.<br>What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br>Yes, I’ve gained a few extra pounds while we were expecting the baby, which has been very difficult.<br>But apparently your body does a nesting, very maternal, primal thing… where it retains nutrients- some sort of molecular physiology thing.<br>But that’s science.<br>You can’t- You can’t fight it, so-<br>I’m not saying anything.<br>You’re saying everything.<br>Count to three.<br>One, two-<br>Three.<br>Okay.<br>Oh, Cam. This is beautiful.<br>Oh, my God.<br>Do you love it?<br>Yes, I-<br>What the hell is that?<br>I had Andre do it while we were gone.<br>Is that us, with wings?<br>We’re floating above her, always there to protect her.<br>Okay. Well, that’s reassuring, right, Lily?<br>Yes, we tore you away from everything you know, but don’t worry, things are normal here.<br>Your fathers are floating fairies.<br>No, can you call Andre, have him paint something a little less gay?<br>By the way, we need to stop having friends with names like Andre.<br>Redheaded dad is angry daddy.<br>No, I’m not.<br>Yes, you are.<br>Even Pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport.<br>Okay, that’s another one-<br>Pepper.<br>Okay, what’s up?<br>All right, look. I-<br>I- I never told my family we were adopting a baby.<br>And-<br>I know.<br>You do?<br>Yeah, and I don’t blame you.<br>I know your family.<br>You’d tell ‘em. They’d say something judgmental.<br>Exactly.<br>You’d get mad.<br>I know. And then something that’s supposed to be nothing but joyful… suddenly turns into this huge fight.<br>And who wants a big, emotional scene like that?<br>Thank you. Thank you.<br>I’m so- I’m so relieved you understand.<br>I invited them over for dinner tonight.<br>What?<br>I had to.<br>This would have gone on forever. You’re an avoider.<br>No. No. No.<br>Cam, I’m calling them right now and canceling.<br>No, you’re not.<br>You’re telling your family you adopted a baby, tonight.<br>And you do have avoidance issues.<br>Even Longinus said so.<br>Are- Are you really not hearing these names?<br>[Doorbell Rings]<br>Haley: Don’t answer it!<br>I’ll get it!<br>Hi.<br>Hey, you must be Dylan.<br>Hey.<br>Dylan. Yeah.<br>I’m Haley’s mother.<br>Hey.<br>Mm-hmm.<br>Come on. Let’s go.<br>[Clears Throat]<br>Okay. Um-<br>Hang on one second.<br>Um- Whoa.<br>Dylan, you’re still in high school?<br>Yeah, I’m a senior.<br>A senior.<br>Okay. Cool.<br>Hey, Phil. Sweetie. Honey.<br>He is Dylan, and he is a senior.<br>[Whispers] You have to scare him.<br>Let me meet this “playa.”<br>Phil Dunphy, yo.<br>It’s like that. You just- You just stare down at ‘em, let the eyes do the work.<br>Your mouth might be saying, “Hey, we cool,” but your eyes are like, “No, we not.”<br>“Nice to meet you.”<br>“No, it’s not.”<br>“It’s all good.”<br>[Mutters]<br>Yo.<br>Yo.<br>Okay, I see you two guys-<br>Wait, wait, wait.<br>You two-<br>You two keep it real, know what I mean, son?<br>Not really.<br>Please, stop.<br>That’s cool.<br>Ow.<br>Oh, God! That’s my back.<br>Oh, honey. Sweetheart.<br>Ow! Oh!<br>I slipped in the baby oil.<br>“Oh, where you from originally?”<br>“I could defeat you if it came to a physical confrontation.”<br>Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!<br>I don’t know about this. Should I call a doctor?<br>No, no, no, no, no.<br>Okay.<br>You’re very strong, homes.<br>Thanks.<br>Okay. Nice- Nice soft landing.<br>There you go.<br>Okay.<br>I am on my side though.<br>Okay, let’s go. Come on.<br>So just flip me right back, and we’re good. [Sighs]<br>We’ll be good.<br>I just need to get flipped right on my back, and we should be fine. So-<br>Brenda Feldman.<br>What is that?<br>A poem I have written for Brenda Feldman.<br>Of course it is.<br>I put my thoughts into words and now my words into action.<br>Hey, I’ll give you 50 bucks not to do this.<br>I’m 11 years old. What am I gonna do with money?<br>What are you gonna do with a 16-year-old?<br>He’s like a bullfighter.<br>Mmm.<br>You ever see a bullfight?<br>I can’t watch this.<br>You’re in such a bad mood.<br>And I know why.<br>It’s because that man thought you were my father.<br>No.<br>Yes.<br>No.<br>When you say “No” like that, it’s always “Yes.”<br>Come on. We’re in the mall.<br>Let’s get you, like, some younger clothes.<br>There’s a store there.<br>I don’t need any younger clothes.<br>And I don’t care what some jackass in a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me.<br>Good. You shouldn’t.<br>You should only care what I think.<br>I love you, and I don’t care how old you are.<br>So stop being a gloomy goose and stop being so hard on Manny.<br>The only reason I’m hard on Manny… is just because I don’t wanna see him make a fool of himself.<br>And I can smell that hair goo of his from here.<br>Look, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to him over there.<br>But you’re his family now, and that means only one thing-<br>You be the wind in his back, not the spit in his face.<br>What?<br>It’s something my mom always says.<br>It’s gorgeous in Spanish.<br>Look, he’s there.<br>She has a boyfriend.<br>Oh, I’m sorry, mi niño.<br>I gave her my heart, she gave me a picture of me as an old-time sheriff.<br>Oh.<br>That was pretty stupid of me, wasn’t it?<br>No, mi amor.<br>It was brave.<br>Right, Jay? Brave.<br>W-Well, you’ll know better next time.<br>Come on.<br>Let’s get a pretzel.<br>Mentira.<br>A mí sí me gusta.<br>Uh, excuse me, sir. We ask that all mall-walkers stay to the right.<br>Haley: Alex, get out! Mom!<br>Alex, leave your sister alone.<br>I was just getting my book.<br>Gosh.<br>I know, sweetie. But you need to respect their privacy.<br>What are they doing up there?<br>Nothing.<br>Lying on her bed, watching a movie.<br>Okay. Okay.<br>Um, I’m making a cake for tonight. You wanna help me with the frosting?<br>Sure.<br>So, you know, if Haley got pregnant, would you ever pretend she has mono for a few months, and then, like, tell everyone the baby’s yours?<br>What?<br>This senior at school was “out sick” for four months, but Jenna Resnick swears she saw her breast-feeding at a coin-op car wash.<br>[Sighs]<br>Buddy, what are you wearing?<br>Nothing.<br>Uh-uh. No jacket.<br>One hat.<br>How many pairs of underwear do you have on?<br>One.<br>[Sighs]<br>Six.<br>First of all, it would be really cool to see Haley that fat.<br>And how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who’s really my nephew.<br>Haley is not getting pregnant. [Clears Throat]<br>Just saying “if.”<br>I know.<br>And I know you like to make trouble for your sister, but it’s not gonna work this time.<br>You know why? ‘Cause your sister’s a good girl.<br>I know. I was just like her when I was-<br>I want you to know, I’m not enjoying this.<br>But this is an important lesson that you’re learning.<br>So, soak it.<br>Keep it.<br>[Clearing Throat]<br>You’re too close.<br>It’s gonna hurt.<br>It’s supposed to hurt.<br>And why are you smiling?<br>I’m- What?<br>Oh, forget it. I can’t do this.<br>The point is you’re scared. I think you’ve learned your lesson.<br>[Shoots]<br>Wow.<br>Ow!<br>Mom! What are you doing?<br>Oh, hey! I was just, um, dropping off some laundry.<br>Is this a bad time?<br>Yeah.<br>Oh. Okay.<br>Uh, can you shut the door, please?<br>Actually, we’re just gonna go ahead and leave that open.<br>Why?<br>Because I have, uh, seen this little show before- lying on the bed with a tall senior.<br>One minute you’re just friends, watching Falcon Crest, and the next you’re lying underneath the air hockey table with your bra in your pocket.<br>Whoa. Mom!<br>[Whimpering] You hit my bone!<br>It was an accident!<br>I thought you were my friend!<br>I am your friend.<br>Dad! Dad, Dad. You have got to talk to Mom.<br>She is, like, completely freaking out and embarrassing me!<br>Honey, your mom isn’t always as cool about things as-<br>[Shoots]<br>Ow!<br>What is with this thing?<br>[Shoots]<br>Ow!<br>My dad. Uh, my dad still isn’t completely comfortable with this.<br>Um- He-He still does this thing.<br>It’s been five years now.<br>And he still does this thing where he announces himself… before walking into any room we’re in… just to make sure he doesn’t have to ever see us kiss.<br>Wish my mother had that system.<br>Remember?<br>Not now.<br>I still can’t believe you did this to me.<br>Would you get in the spirit of things?<br>It’s a celebration.<br>[Doorbell Rings]<br>Oh, God.<br>Okay, I’m gonna go get Lily ready.<br>Okay.<br>And I want you to just come straight out with it.<br>All right.<br>Okay. You can do this.<br>Yeah.<br>Sports guy chest bump.<br>No.<br>Sports guy chest bump.<br>Cam. Oh!<br>All right. Go.<br>Do it. Go.<br>Sorry.<br>Oh.<br>[Exhales]<br>Hey. Hi.<br>Hey.<br>How are you?<br>Hi, guys.<br>Hey.<br>That looks good.<br>Oh, thank you. Thanks.<br>Don’t thank us. Open it.<br>Dad is coming right behind.<br>[Doorbell Ringing]<br>[Knocking]<br>Jay: Knock, knock! We’re here.<br>Coming in!<br>Don’t worry, Dad.<br>Nothing gay going on here.<br>May I take your multicolored coat and bejeweled cap?<br>Yeah. Yeah.<br>Hey, Jay.<br>Gloria, hi.<br>Hi.<br>How are you?<br>Hi, Dad.<br>Hi, Gloria. How are you?<br>Oh, what a beautiful dress.<br>Ay, thank you, Phil.<br>Okay.<br>Oh, hey-<br>Phil.<br>That’s how she says “Phil.”<br>Not “feel.” Phil.<br>Oh.<br>So how was your trip?<br>It was good.<br>It was good actually.<br>But, um, about that, I- I have something that I need to tell you guys.<br>Um- Uh, we didn’t just go to Vietnam for pleasure.<br>We, uh, kind of have some big news.<br>Oh, God. If Cam comes out here with boobs, I’m leaving.<br>Claire: Dad.<br>I hope he didn’t embarrass you, Mom.<br>Oh, don’t mind her.<br>Haley had her first boy over today… and Phil shot him.<br>Anyway, um, so, about- about a year ago, Cam and I started feeling this longing, you know, for something more, like, uh, maybe a baby?<br>Ooh, that’s a bad idea.<br>What do you mean, “bad idea”?<br>Well, kids need a mother.<br>I mean if you two guys are bored, get a dog.<br>Okay, we’re not bored, Dad.<br>I support you, Mitchell, even though you’re not my son.<br>I-I-I-I think what Dad is trying to say… is that, Mitchell, you’re a little uptight.<br>Kids bring chaos, and- and you don’t handle it well.<br>That’s not what Dad’s saying.<br>That’s what you’re saying.<br>And it’s insulting in a whole different way.<br>Okay, people. Let’s all “chillax.”<br>Hey, where’s Uncle Cameron?<br>Thank you. Thank you.<br>Someone who’s not insulting me notices he’s not here.<br>Oh, so that’s the big announcement, huh?<br>You two broke up.<br>Well- Well, a baby wasn’t gonna help that anyway.<br>And let me tell you. You’re better off, because he was a bit of a drama queen.<br>No, no, no. Stop. Stop. No.<br>You come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend, who, by the way, is not that dramatic-<br>♪♪ [Stereo: Man Singing in Zulu]<br>Oh, God.<br>♪♪ [Chorus Singing in Zulu]<br>Man:<br>♪ It’s the circle of life ♪<br>We adopted a baby.<br>♪ And it moves us all ♪<br>Her name is Lily.<br>Oh.<br>Exciting!<br>Just turn it off.<br>I can’t turn it off.
